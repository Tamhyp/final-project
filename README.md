This report will focus on estimating the admission rate for U.S colleges and universities.

The simulation file will create a data set under the folder input-data to get the desired data set. Then run the rscript file, this clean and modify the dataset and loads the cleaned dataset into the Inputs Folder. Then run the bib file for references and citations, then run the rmd file.

The repository contains the following:

1.The input folder:

The data set admission.csv as the original data set from the website

2.The scripts folder:

The Scripts.R file contains the code for reading in the data, cleaning and modifying the variables, and saving the csv file.

3.The output folder:

This folder contains our output report.The rmd file contains the report on the selection of the model to predict admission rate.

The pdf file contains the official report with only graphs and tables,no R code is included.

The bib file contains the citations of websites and packages used in R.

Abstract:

It is common for applicants to review a school's basic information and characteristics before they decide to apply for the school. Applicants need to compete with others. Hence, they are willing to know the opportunity of getting an offer. In this paper,we are going to examine the admission rate of a large amount of universities/colleges in U.S and try to predict the admission rate for a given university.
